# gravity
Drop planets and watch them moving by gravity law. The radius of the circle corresponds to its mass which could be changed in the first line.
The radius can be only between 2 and 10, however, mass could be any. Drag mouse1 clicked to set up the body velocity.
The "draw me 8!" button clears all and set up an initial data for special celestial mechanics 3-body task, unfortunately with low accuracy.
Updated method from Euler to leapfrog.
Added line, pointing the initial direction and text at start piont showing value of the starting velocity.
